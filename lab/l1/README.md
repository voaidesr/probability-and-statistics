# Bertrand's paradox

Bertrand's Paradox demonstrates that probabilities can depend on the method by which a random selection is made.

The paradox is centered on a single question: What is the probability that a random chord drawn in a circle is longer than the side of an inscribed equilateral triangle?

## First choice of chord

The **Random Endpoints Method**. In this simulation, two random points are chosen on the circumference and connected. Visually, about one-third of the chords are longer than the side of an inscribed equilateral triangle (shown in red).


The probability is $\frac{1}{3}$. Simulating this choice with 10'000 chords, this image is rendered:
